# PyApps
This repository will contain scripts of some basic application developed using Python which are a part of a Udemy course, I have been following. These applications may not serve any purpose to the real world (maybe, it would) but the whole purpose of these application is just to sharpen my understanding on the OOP aspect in Python.
